# CSS Styling Exercise

Not a lot of instructions here. Use a variety of CSS Selectors to style the page elements **as specifically as possible**. Think about using CSS rules like the following: 
- width
- height
- min-width
- min-height
- color
- background-color
- border
- margin 
- padding

In terms of selectors, try selecting by **element**, **class**, and **id**.  Then tyr using **child** and **descendant** selectors that combine some of those.
